## Scheduling, Meetings and Administration

- **Differing Work Styles**: Academia is conducive to a variety of different work styles - people can have successful professional careers working 9-5 on-site, or remotely in the small hours of the morning, as well as everything in-between. Lab members are encouraged to find the style that works best for them, so long as that allows them to make the needed progress in their program, interact with fellow lab-members and collaborators as necessary, etc. Unless otherwise specified (a scheduled meeting, a lab-wide activity, etc.) there are no mandatory hours where you *must* be in the lab.

### One-on-One Meetings

### Lab-wide Meetings

- **Lab Dinners**: On occasion (approximately once or twice a semester) Dr. Lofgren will organize and host a "lab dinner", either at his house, a local park, restaurant, etc. These are intended as social occasions, to help the lab get together in a relaxed, social and non-academic environment. Lab members are encouraged to attend, but these are by no means mandatory. Feel free to bring spouses, significant others, children, etc.
